# Individually-Addressable-LED-Cube
4x4x4 Led cube using individually addressable led's. 
I apologies for the poor coding practices as this was one of my first projects a number of years ago. 
There is also to different libraries used to write to the led's as I was playing around with producible patterns in both.
